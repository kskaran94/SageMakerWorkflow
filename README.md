An Introduction to Linear Learner with MNIST
Making a Binary Prediction of Whether a Handwritten Digit is a 0


This an example to use Amazon Sagemaker. SageMaker allows one to build a ML pipeline easily. Building, training and deploying of ML models is less cumbersome with SageMaker

In this example, I will be using a Amazon's marketplace algorithm (Linear Learner). The purpose of the notebook is to explain the usage of sagemaker and not the modeling aspect.The data used in this is mnist and problem is framed as binary classification.

Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner algorithm extends upon typical linear models by training many models in parallel, in a computationally efficient manner. Each model has a different set of hyperparameters, and then the algorithm finds the set that optimizes a specific criteria. This can provide substantially more accurate models than typical linear algorithms at the same, or lower, cost.
